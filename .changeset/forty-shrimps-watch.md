feat(ui): Updates spacing and sizing of components. Introduces new `size` variants for some components, such as `Button`, `IconButton`, and `Avatar`. Change most `:focus` styles to `:focus-visible` styles, to prevenent focus styles from being visible when not needed, such as on button clicks.
feat(ui-preset): Publishes latest updates to our design system styles, as well as adding new colors. Noticable changes include changing `ui-code-text-*` styles to `ui-code-fg-*` for better consistency.
feat(icons): Updates the `LockClosedSolid` and `LockOpenSolid` icons, and introduces four new icons: `LockClosedSolidMini`, `TriangleLeftMini`, `TriangleRightMini`, and `TriangleMini`.
